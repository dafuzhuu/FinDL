# Introduction

This is a manual about the usage of deep learning in quant, written for members in WISERCLUB. This page provides various learning materials used to get insights in financial deep learning (FinDL). But things all mess up when you get information from different resources, especially when some of them are marginal. Since this manual focuses on deep learning in finance, Iâ€™ll introduce the deep learning algorithms in minimal complexity (with little math derivations), and put more emphasis on how to apply those models in finance.
